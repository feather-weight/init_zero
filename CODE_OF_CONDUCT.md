# Code of Conduct

We are building tooling to **strengthen crypto** through education, monitoring, and lawful recovery. Our community thrives when everyone feels welcome, respected, and safe.

## Our Pledge
We pledge to make participation in this project a harassment‑free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, education, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Respectful, constructive feedback; focus on ideas over individuals
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes
- Using inclusive language and assuming good faith

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- Harassment, trolling, or derogatory comments
- Public or private harassment, doxxing, or threats
- Sexualized language or imagery
- Hate speech or discrimination of any kind
- Encouraging or enabling **illegal activity** (e.g., theft of funds)

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards. They may take appropriate corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
This Code applies within all project spaces and when an individual is representing the project in public spaces (online or offline).

## Enforcement
Report unacceptable behavior to **[REPLACE_WITH_CONTACT_EMAIL]** or **[REPLACE_WITH_SECURE_FORM_URL]**. All complaints will be reviewed promptly and fairly. The team will respect the reporter’s privacy.

## Enforcement Guidelines
1. **Correction** — Private, written warning with guidance.
2. **Warning** — Official warning; continued behavior may lead to temporary bans.
3. **Temporary Ban** — From community spaces for a defined period.
4. **Permanent Ban** — For severe violations or sustained pattern of violations.
