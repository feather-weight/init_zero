# Step 1(a): Create Base Structure

This step creates a clean, incremental baseline (directories, `.env`, minimal `docker-compose.yml` with **Mongo only**), then verifies the stack can **start without errors**. This mirrors the “tiny slices, always green” approach: add one piece, test it, keep it working.  

- Philosophy: break the work into many tiny scripts, each with a test and a PDF note.  
- Outcome: repository stands up cleanly with Docker + Mongo today.
